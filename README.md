# Final State Machine example in Java

This is one of the simplest and good looking FSM written in Java.  
All implementation contained in the same file which takes only ~100 lines of code (with examples).

 ## Example
 
This example shows the transitions within the media player at the touch of a button.

Each transition contains a simple demo action that prints a text to the console.

```java
    Set<Transition> musicTransitions = new HashSet<>(asList(
        new Transition(State.MUSIC_STOPPED /* ‚è© */, State.MUSIC_PLAYING,/* üî• */ Event.PRESSED_PLAY_BUTTON, /* üöÄ */ Example.playAction),
        new Transition(State.MUSIC_PLAYING /* ‚è© */, State.MUSIC_PAUSED, /* üî• */ Event.PRESSED_PAUSE_BUTTON,/* üöÄ */ Example.pauseAction),
        new Transition(State.MUSIC_PLAYING /* ‚è© */, State.MUSIC_STOPPED,/* üî• */ Event.PRESSED_STOP_BUTTON, /* üöÄ */ Example.stopAction),
        new Transition(State.MUSIC_PAUSED  /* ‚è© */, State.MUSIC_STOPPED,/* üî• */ Event.PRESSED_STOP_BUTTON, /* üöÄ */ Example.stopAction),
        new Transition(State.MUSIC_PAUSED  /* ‚è© */, State.MUSIC_PLAYING,/* üî• */ Event.PRESSED_PLAY_BUTTON, /* üöÄ */ Example.playAction)
    ));
    IState initialState = State.MUSIC_STOPPED;
    
    FSM musicFSM = new FSM(musicTransitions, initialState);
    
    // Let's create some music events and then run them
    List<IEvent> musicPlayerAutoScript = asList(
        Event.PRESSED_PLAY_BUTTON,
        Event.PRESSED_PAUSE_BUTTON,
        // Example of Event with data
        DataEvent.of(Event.PRESSED_PLAY_BUTTON, "(Bob Marley - Bad Boys)"),
        Event.PRESSED_STOP_BUTTON
    );
    
    for (IEvent playerEvent : musicPlayerAutoScript)
        musicFSM.fireTransitionEvent(playerEvent);
```

The result would be the following:

## Real usage improvements

- Add null checks (at least in `fireTransitionEvent()` method of the FSM class).
- Pass `fsm` as the second argument to `run()` method in `IAction`. This feature will allow you, for example, to call `fsm.fireTransitionEvent()` in `afterTransitionAction` 
and your FSM will be able to switch to the next state automatically.
